As a freshman at NC State, I have enjoyed my CSC classes thus far. Right now, I'm taking CSC 216/217 and CSC 298. Both courses are challenging in their own way, but I know that I have been growing and developing my skills, which I appreciate. I'm also involved with the Women in Computer Science and Competitive Programming clubs. I enjoy the sense of community within the clubs, and I want to grow into the position where I can provide the sense of community to younger students in the future.
