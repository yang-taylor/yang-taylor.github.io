## Goals

### Coding
My current WIP is [Sudoku](https://github.com/tayleyi/sudoku).
For that project, I'll be using Flask (Python) for the backend, most likely hosted on Vercel.
I'll be using ReactJS for the front-end.
The project will most likely use a SQL database, hosted on PlanetScale.
My biggest challenge right now is being able to generate new game boards from the back end.

At the same time, I'll also be working on extending my [Family Feud]({% link _posts/2021-04-09-creative-space-java.md %}) project.
I'll be attempting to add authentication and a database,
so that the game host will be able to use the web interface, rather than the Google Doc.

Right now, I'll also be starting to collect data on cost per wear for my clothes.
I'm thinking of creating a data science project based upon that data.

When the sudoku project is done, I want to build an site similar to [Receiptify](https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/).
I'm thinking of using Java Spring, the Apple Music API (for the iCloud Music Library), and ReactJS.
Or maybe even PocketBase, in a Docker Container.

Other than straight coding, I'll be trying to read [computer science research papers](https://arxiv.org/list/cs/recent), as well.
Maybe three per week is a bit of a lofty goal; I'll adjust as needed.

### Music
I do want to get better piano, but I don't have easy access to an instrument.
Sometimes, it's okay to de-prioritise goals that don't fit into your life.

### Speaking
I want to get better at speaking at smoother pace.
To do that, I'll be booking study rooms at the library, and recording myself.
I'll be either reading from an article or answering on-the-spot questions.
I want to be able to practice prepared (memorized) speeches at some point, but that isn't part of the plan right now.

### Chinese
I come from a Mandarin-speaking family.
However, I am effectively illiterate, and my speaking skills are somewhat subpar as well.
My goal is to reach the [TOCFL](https://tocfl.edu.tw/) fluency of Band B-4 by the end of 2023.
In order to do that, I'll be studying from books on Chinese idioms (from the school library).
Maybe, in the future, I'll purchase actual workbooks and graded reading books.
However, since I currently am only able to commit 1.5 hours to practice each week, so I don't want to commit financially to this.


### Art 

### Low Buy
Trying to save money is hard.
My goal is to spend <$200 on non-essentials per statement.
Essentials include cleaning/household items (detergent, trash bags, cleaning solution, etc)

- Stationery

I'm on a no-buy for stationery.
That should work; I have a solid collection of writing utensils and ink,
and my school has a place where I can get free notebooks.

- Perfume

I'll only be trying fragrances in-stores, rather than purchasing travel sizes or samples.
This applies until I can finish up my travel size fragrances, which may take a while.

- Makeup

I don't have any needs to fill in makeup right now.
So, I'll only re-purchasing when I run out of the following items: 
brow gel, all lip products, blush, skin tint.
Even then, when the product costs more than $10, I'll need to try it first in-store.

- Skincare

Skincare is a way I practice self-care, so I'm not going to completely give it up.
However, I don't have any gaps in my routine, 
so I shouldn't be buying anything just for the sake of it.

- Bags

I have too many bags right now.
I'm on a no-buy for these.

- Jewelry 

I don't wear jewelry, I'm on a no-buy for them.
