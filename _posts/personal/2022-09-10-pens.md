I like a good pen.
Since I'm a student, I write a lot for homework and studying.
I'm big on journaling, but it's something I want to get into the future.

## "Normal" Pens
I'm a fountain pen girl, but sometimes, I'm not in a situation where I can't use them.
In those cases, my default regular pens are:
- Pilot G2 (a classic)
- Pilot V7 Precise
- uni-ball Vision Needle

## Fountain Pens
I got into fountain pens mostly because of the environmentally-friendly aspect.
Unfortunately, I have acquired quite a few pens, so perhaps I have deviated from my goal, somewhat.
Here are the ones that I own:
- Pilot Kakuno, Fine, Clear
- Pilot Kakuno, Medium, Pastel Blue/White
- TWSBI Diamond 580, Medium, Iris

## Fountain Pen Inks
I own fewer inks than I do fountain pens. However, it's still enough to list:
- Sailor Black
- Diamine Monboddo's Hat
