I like a good pen.
Since I'm a student, I write a lot for homework and studying.
I'm big on journaling, but it's something I want to get into the future.

## "Normal" Pens
I'm a fountain pen girl, but sometimes, I'm not in a situation where I can't use them.
In those cases, my default regular pens are:
- Pilot G2 (a classic): 
This was my favorite pen for most of high school, I used it a lot for writing in AP classes.
I liked how I could be pretty hard on the pen,
and the ink still wouldn't skip and the tip would never get damaged.
Plus, the refills were pretty cheap as well.
Since starting with the G2, I have mostly stopped using pencils to write with.

- Pilot V7 Precise:
I discovered this from an architect YouTube channel, and fell in love with how smooth it wrote.

- uni-ball Vision Needle
Funny story: I found one of these pens on the floor of a classroom, right when I needed a pen.
I tried it out, and I loved it.
It doesn't feel quite as smooth as the Pilot Precise,
but it has a finer tip, so I can write smaller text with it.

## Fountain Pens
I got into fountain pens mostly because of the environmentally-friendly aspect.
Unfortunately, I have acquired quite a few pens, so perhaps I have deviated from my goal, somewhat.
Here are the ones that I own:
- Pilot Kakuno, Medium, Clear:
This was my second ever fountain pen, and the one that truly converted me into the hobby.
My first pen was a LAMY Safari, which I didn't enjoy writing with,
even when I switched to a different nib.
However, the medium Kakuno writes smoothly, boldly, and was a fantastic experience overall.
I use a CON-70 converter with this pen, which has enough capacity for a week's worth of college work.

- TWSBI Diamond 580, Medium, Iris
I bought this when it first came out.
I had been planning on purchasing a TWSBI plan for a while,
but I couldn't decide between the Vac-700R Iris, or the TWSBI Diamond 580 in Rose Gold.
The decision was somehow made for me when this pen came out;
I love the colors of the Iris, but I still wanted a piston filler pen.
Since this pen is more expensive, I don't carry it around with me.
However, I still get lots of use out of it,
since I practice writing Chinese characters with it.

- Pilot Kakuno, Extra Fine, White/Pastel Blue
I wanted try a Pilot extra fine nib, so I settled on this pen.
I kind of wanted to also try the Metropolitan pen body,
but since the model doesn't offer an extra fine,
I decided to get a copy of the first fountain pen that I enjoyed.
I use this pen with a CON-B converter,
but I don't refill this often because I prefer to write with broader nibs.

## Fountain Pen Inks
I own fewer inks than I do fountain pens. However, it's still enough to list:
- Sailor Black:
This is a very normal black color, nothing particularly special about it.
It is not waterproof, which is not ideal because North Carolina summers can be a bit rainy,
and I've had my notebooks bleed away in the past.

- Diamine Monboddo's Hat
This is a very nice purple shade.
The bottle is plastic, which eases my state of mind a bit,
since I'm not too worried about dropping it.
Purple is one of my favorite colors, so it was one of the first ink colors that I tried.
