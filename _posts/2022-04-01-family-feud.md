In my senior year of high school, one of my clubs hosted a “Game Night” fundraiser event.
I decided to create an interface for our version of Family Feud.

It’s not perfect; the answer bank is quite static, and cannot be edited on the fly.
The questions are housed on a separate text document, to prevent cheating from the screen.
So, the only people who can play this version of the game are people with access to the question bank and answer key. 
However, we were able to successfully play four rounds of the game using this web app.
