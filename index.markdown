Hey there!

I’m Taylor, a computer science student at North Carolina State University. I’m currently taking CSC 216/217 (Software Development Fundamentals). I have previously attended Guilford College, where I took CTIS 210 (Introduction to Computer Programming), CTIS 321 (Operating Systems), and MATH 241 (Scientific Computing).

I first started taking computer science seriously in summer 2020, when I taught myself Java with online resources. From there, I embarked on a journey of learning as much as possible—from building functioning websites, to experimenting with the Linux command line, to solving math problems with Julia.

Outside of coding, I enjoy playing tennis, writing with fountain pens, and riding my bike around town. I’m currently reading Educated by Tara Westover.
