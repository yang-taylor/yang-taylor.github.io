Hey there!

I’m Taylor, a computer science student at North Carolina State University.
I’m currently taking CSC 216/217[^216] and CSC 298[^298].
I have previously attended Guilford College, where I took CTIS 210, CTIS 321, and MATH 241[^GC].

I first started taking computer science seriously in summer 2020, when I taught myself Java with online resources. 
From there, I embarked on a journey of learning as much as possible—from building functioning websites,
to experimenting with the Linux command line, to solving math problems with Julia.

Outside of coding, I enjoy playing tennis, writing with fountain pens, and riding my bike around town.
