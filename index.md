Hey there!

I’m Taylor, a computer science student at North Carolina State University.
I’m currently taking:
- CSC 216/217: Software Development Fundamentals
- CSC 298: Research Methods in Computer Science

In high school, I took dual enrollment courses at Guilford College.
There, I took Intro to Programming, Operating Systems, and Scientific Computing.

I first started exploring computer science in high school.
From there, I embarked on a journey of learning as much as possible—from building functioning websites,
to experimenting with the Linux command line, to solving math problems with Julia.

Outside of coding, I enjoy playing tennis, writing with fountain pens, and riding my bike around town.
